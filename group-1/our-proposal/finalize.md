The Catalyst School: what is it all about?

The Catalyst School, already established, is a place created to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles. The Catalyst School | LATAM will provide similar services as The Catalyst School, but in the Portuguese and Spanish languages.

We aim to onboard new members and help improve their skills along the way, in any way they decide to engage with Catalyst: as a Proposer, a Community Advisor, a Veteran Community Advisor, or without any specific role within the process. In order for Catalyst to flourish and reach its full potential, all these roles need to give their best contribution within the process.

With the encouragement and support of Catalyst Swarm and Eastern Town Hall, this proposal is also a CALL for purpose driven people in LATAM to join the MOVEMENT and is part of a 4 pillars CLUSTER driven by the LATAM Catalyst Community, that includes:

LATAM Town Hall: [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/LATAM-Town-Hall-by-Catalyst-Swarm/380974-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/LATAM-Town-Hall-by-Catalyst-Swarm/380974-48088)

DALE: [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/DALE/381093-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/DALE/381093-48088)

LATAM Cardano Ambassadors: [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Ambassadors-Latin-America/380977-48088](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Ambassadors-Latin-America/380977-48088)

The main topics we are willing to cover by the Catalyst School | LATAM are:

\- Introduction to Catalyst

\- Proposing in Catalyst

\- How to be a Community Advisor

\- How to be a Veteran Community Advisor

\- Why do we need the Catalyst School | LATAM?

&#x20;

Catalyst is not a traditional funding platform, it has its own protocol and functioning method. Therefore, anyone who wants to join this experiment needs to learn about it first.

The general perception is that Latin American communities are not fully aware of Cardano and Catalyst, and there is also the language barrier once English is not commonly spoken in the region.

Our proposal aims to bring together the Latin American communities which have an interest in the process of learning about Catalyst, be they, newcomers or veterans, so they can exchange knowledge and help each other in their own languages.

&#x20;

Our basic Website

The Catalyst School LATAM will include a basic website (in Portuguese and English) consisting of two main parts:

\- Gitbook

All the content and the resources used for the Catalyst School will be published in a public Git repository with an Open Source license and presented to the users through Gitbook (https://www.gitbook.com/), a platform for publishing documentation.

\- Landing page

The landing page will include:

\- A subscription form to collect students and engage them with periodical emails and resources

\- A visual index to help users navigate through all the resources published in the GitBook

\- A basic quiz about the "Introduction to Catalyst"

\- The Plan: Roadmap and Milestones

This proposal aims to provide the School session and workshops (in Spanish and Portuguese). When funded, we will provide all these services for the next 2 Funds (Funds 8 and 9).

School Sessions and workshops are planned to be weekly. Also, the sessions are going to be synchronized with each phase of Project Catalyst, so we increase the value delivered by them.

Our goal is to provide 12 sessions in each Fund, following the Project Catalyst schedule. Therefore, our roadmap (per Fund) is:

\- Week 1 - Insight Sharing Phase:

2 x Introduction to Catalyst (In Portuguese and Spanish)

\- Week 2 - Proposal Submission Phase:

2 x Proposing in Catalyst (In Portuguese and Spanish)

\- Week 3 - Proposal Refinement Phase:

2 x Proposing in Catalyst (In Portuguese and Spanish)

\- Week 4 - Proposal Finalize Phase:

2 x How to be a Community Advisor (In Portuguese and Spanish)

\- Week 5 - Proposal Assessment Phase:

2 x How to be a Veteran Community Advisor (In Portuguese and Spanish)

\- Week 6 - Assessments Review Phase:

2 x How to be a Veteran Community Advisor (In Portuguese and Spanish)

\-> This road map and sessions/workshops schedule can be adapted and changed based on community feedback and needs.

Therefore, our milestones and success definition are:

\-> 3 months after funded (end of Fund 8):

\- Learning content created for the School sessions and workshops.

\- Host 12 School sessions or workshops

\-> 6 months after funded (end of Fund 8):

\- Host 12 School sessions or workshops

&#x20;

We will track the success of this project by measuring the:

\- Total number of community members who get involved with the Catalyst School.
